## Penetration Testing Toolkit

This project is a basic penetration testing toolkit created using Python. It includes simple modules to perform security testing tasks commonly used in ethical hacking and cybersecurity analysis.

## Features

1. Port Scanner
Scans a target IP address to find open ports. This helps identify which services are running and potentially vulnerable.

2. Brute Forcer (Demo)
A basic brute-force login tester. It attempts to crack credentials by trying multiple password combinations (demo version for educational use only).

## Modules

main.py: The entry point of the program, with menu selection for tools.

port_scanner.py: Contains the logic for scanning open ports.

brute_forcer.py: Contains the brute-force attempt logic.

.gitignore: Ignores unnecessary files (like .pyc or cache files).

README.md: Project documentation.
